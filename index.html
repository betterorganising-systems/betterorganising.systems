        Better Organising Systems
    </h1>
    <p> 
    Left wing movements suffer from chronic problems understanding security, and lack the toolsets to think in an organised manner about them. 
    </p>
    <p>
We aim to help organisations understand the risks they face and how to secure against them on an organisational level, avoiding placing the onus on overworked activists by designing processes which reduce the overhead of achieving your goals in the face of your specific set of adversaries. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If your organisation needs support with, reach out to <a href="mailto:hi@betterorganising.systems">hi@betterorganising.systems</a> and we can discuss your threats and needs. 
    </p>
    <p>
A portion of our time is dedicated to working at no cost with groups who's main work is anticarceral or anticolonial.
